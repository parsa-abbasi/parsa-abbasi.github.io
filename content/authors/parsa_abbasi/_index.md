Parsa is currently pursuing a doctoral degree at Paderborn University as a research associate in the [Data Science Junior Research Group](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/ds-jrg).  He is conducting research under the supervision of [Dr. Stefan Heindorf](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/11871), focusing on explainable machine learning for knowledge graphs. He holds a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Iran University of Science and Technology, where he conducted research aimed at improving graph neural networks for relational graphs. His work sought to enhance existing architectures like RAGAT by proposing and developing a model with fewer training parameters that addresses static attention issues.

Parsa also earned his BSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Guilan, where he explored areas such as natural language processing and deep learning. During his undergraduate studies, he co-authored a research paper on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resource Persian language.
