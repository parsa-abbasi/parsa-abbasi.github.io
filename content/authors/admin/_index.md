      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

*Parsa* is currently pursuing a doctoral degree at [*Paderborn University*](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/) as a research associate in the [*Data Science Junior Research Group*](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/ds-jrg).  He is conducting research under the supervision of [*Dr. Stefan Heindorf*](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/11871), focusing on explainable machine learning for knowledge graphs. He holds a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [*Iran University of Science and Technology*](https://www.iust.ac.ir/en), where he conducted research aimed at improving graph neural networks for multi-relational graphs. His work sought to enhance existing architectures like *RAGAT* by proposing and developing a model with fewer training parameters that addresses static attention issues.

*Parsa* also earned his BSc in Computer Engineering from the [*University of Guilan*](https://english.guilan.ac.ir/), where he explored areas such as natural language processing and deep learning. During his undergraduate studies, as a member of the [*Guilan NLP Group*](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir/), he co-authored a research paper on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resource Persian language.
