## About Me

*Parsa* is currently pursuing a doctoral degree at [*Paderborn University*](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/) as a research associate in the [*Data Science Junior Research Group*](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/ds-jrg).  He is conducting research under the supervision of [*Dr. Stefan Heindorf*](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/11871), focusing on explainable machine learning for knowledge graphs. He holds a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [*Iran University of Science and Technology*](https://www.iust.ac.ir/en), where he conducted research aimed at improving graph neural networks for multi-relational graphs. His work sought to enhance existing architectures like *RAGAT* by proposing and developing a model with fewer training parameters that addresses static attention issues.

*Parsa* also earned his BSc in Computer Engineering from the [*University of Guilan*](https://english.guilan.ac.ir/), where he explored areas such as natural language processing and deep learning. During his undergraduate studies, as a member of the [*Guilan NLP Group*](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir/), he co-authored a research paper on designing sentiment analysis models using deep learning architectures for low-resource Persian language.
